Using XBGR Regression 

# Introduction
Practice problems or data science projects are one of the best ways to learn data science.

BigMart Sales Prediction practice problem was launched about a month back on Analytics Vidya platform, and 55,560 data scientists have already registered with 2000 among those making submissions. I have Get 5th Rank in Analytics Vidya with least RSME score. Today I am going to take you through the entire journey of getting started with this data set.

I hope that this article will help more people and also recruiter to know my data science skillsets. 

# The project's primary objectives include:

1. Developing robust regression models for sales prediction.

2. Conducting feature engineering to identify key variables influencing sales.

3. Evaluating model performance to ensure accuracy and reliability.

4. Providing actionable insights and recommendations to Big Mart's retail management team.

        Item_MRP stands for Maximum Retail Price, which is the list price of the product. 
        
        It provides information about the pricing strategy for each product.

* Outlet_Identifier: 

        This is a unique store ID assigned to each outlet or store in the dataset. 
        
        It helps identify different stores where the products are sold.

        It provides information about the age of the store.

* Outlet_Size: 

        Outlet_Size is a categorical variable that describes the size of the store in terms of the ground area it covers. 
        
        It categorizes stores as "Small," "Medium," or "High."

* Outlet_Location_Type:

* Item_Outlet_Sales: 

        This is the target variable for prediction. It represents the sales of a specific product in a particular store. 
        
        The goal of the project is to predict this variable accurately.
